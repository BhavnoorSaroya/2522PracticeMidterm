  // Intermediate Question 03 (10 estimated points, 3 TODOs)
  // Idea: tests your ability to model hierarchies with Java classes.

  // README FIRST
  // I will ONLY be reading from the org.bcit.midterm.answers package.
  // TODO 0: Create a copy of this file in the answers package.
  // Put your answers in new classes that are labeled with the
  // question label, e.g., Intermediate_03_myClass.

  // TODO 1: Create a class structure that represents your understanding
  // of the relationship between Cars, Trucks, and their components.
  // Requirements:
  // - Use at least one abstract class.
  // - Use at least one composition relationship.
  // - Use at least one inheritance relationship.
  // - Use at least one aggregation relationship.
  // You should be able to do this with only attributes and keywords.
  // There is no need to write out the internal logic of methods.
